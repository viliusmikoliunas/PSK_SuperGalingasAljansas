First launch instructions:
1. In Solution explorer under "Dependencies" tab, right-click on "npm" folder and click "restore packages" (this might take a bit)
2. After restoring packages (yellow triangle icon on npm folder should be replaced by black gift icon) press F5
3. At first you might get "FileNotFoundException: Could not find file: /dist/index.html". Stop the project and launch again - it should work now (if it doesn't , try stop and launch few more times)
