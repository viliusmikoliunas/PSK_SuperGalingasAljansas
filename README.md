First launch instructions:

0. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Open project in Visual Studio
2. In Solution explorer under "Dependencies" tab, right-click on "npm" folder and click "restore packages" (this might take a while)
3. After restoring packages (yellow triangle icon on npm folder should be replaced by black gift icon) press F5
4. At first you might get "FileNotFoundException: Could not find file: /dist/index.html". Stop the project and launch again - it should work now (if it doesn't , try stop and launch few more times)
